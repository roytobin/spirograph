## Introduction

A fast spirograph&reg; creation web page for desktop browsers.  Since
there is no animation the completed curve is displayed instantly (when in
"automatic" mode).  Zero dependencies; the HTML, CSS, and javascript are
entirely contained in a single, href-free file.  The adjustable parameters
are not in confusing mathematical terms, but are instead modeled after
the classic spirograph toy, in terms of "teeth" of the ring and gear.
The parameters can be rapidly modified using the mouse scroll wheel via
standard, native, and lightening-fast HTML elements.
